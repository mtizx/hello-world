# hello-world

Hi!

My name is Otto Peyer. This github represents works of mine that I am releasing under the name Mount Izx. Do not expect much of quality here; there is the off-chance that at some point I will code something that people use, but for the most part I intend to use this page to upload random experiments, school projects, and other such things that I have created since the beginning of 2018. I'm not going to do much more explaining of myself or this github, so just enjoy!

In other words: the mission statement of this account is that there is no mission statement! Now buzz off!
